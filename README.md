# Bank Marketing Campaign
### Random Forest

This project uses data on bank customers that were part of a targeted marketing campaign for a Personal Equity Plan (PEP).

We read the data from a link made available through University of Washington:
- https://library.startlearninglabs.uw.edu/DATASCI420/2019/Datasets/Bank%20Data.csv

For replicability, we also provide the raw csv data directly within the repository ([here](https://github.com/lukefiorio/bank_mkt_campaign/raw/main/Bank%20Data.csv)).

#### Abstract

Our data consists of 600 bank customers targeted in a marketing campaign.  Our goal is to build a predictive model for promotional targeting, with future plans to focus only on customers most likely to respond to the promotion.

Specifically, we build and evaluate Decision Tree and Random Forest models to make our predictions and recommendations for future promotions.
